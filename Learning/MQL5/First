If you're looking for a solution that allows you to run your MQL5 robot online and continuously test it even when your computer is turned off, you might consider using a virtual private server (VPS) or a cloud-based hosting service. These services provide remote access to a virtual machine where you can install and run your MT5 platform and MQL5 robot. Here's how you can go about it:

Choose a VPS or cloud hosting provider: There are several reputable providers that offer VPS or cloud hosting services specifically tailored for trading purposes. Some popular options include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and MetaQuotes VPS. You can compare the features, pricing, and availability of these providers to choose the one that suits your requirements.

Set up the virtual machine: Once you've selected a provider, you'll need to set up a virtual machine (VM) on their platform. This involves choosing the specifications for the VM, such as CPU, RAM, and storage capacity, and installing the operating system (e.g., Windows Server) and the MT5 platform.

Install your MQL5 robot: After setting up the VM, you can install the MT5 platform and upload your MQL5 robot to the virtual machine. You can either download the MT5 platform from the official MetaQuotes website or use the installation files provided by your broker.

Configure remote access: To access the virtual machine remotely, you'll need to configure remote desktop access or use a remote desktop client to connect to the VM. The specific steps for remote access will depend on the provider and the operating system you're using on the VM.

Keep the VM running: Once everything is set up, you can keep the virtual machine running 24/7, even when your local computer is turned off. This allows you to perform continuous testing of your MQL5 robot without interruption.

It's important to consider the cost associated with using a VPS or cloud hosting service, as well as any additional fees for data transfer or storage. Be sure to review the pricing plans and select an option that aligns with your budget and testing requirements.
