        Dead State:--->
        A thread is considered dead once its run() method completed execution.
         Although a threadâ€™s run() method completed execution it is still a Thread object, but this Thread object is not a thread of execution.
         Once the thread completes its run() method and dead, it cannot be brought back to thread of execution or even to runnable state.
        Invoking start() method on a dead thread causes runtime exception.
